# Research log

Research done while nothing could run on the PC and no release could ship. Each entry: what was looked at, what was found, what it changed, and **where it stopped** (the next session starts there).

## 2026-11-10

### Running models without other apps (llama.cpp, Jan, LM Studio)
- **llama.cpp fitting** ([discussion #18049](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/18049)): `--fit` is on by default and leaves 1 GB free per GPU (`-fitt`); it shrinks the context first, then moves tensors to system RAM, MoE experts first. Any explicit `-ngl`, `--tensor-split` or `--override-tensor` turns it off completely. An explicit `-c` is kept.
  - Changed: 0.6.41 drops KesherAI's old `-ngl 99` default on b7400+ builds (it froze self-work when two models shared the 3090), and the embedding engine no longer forces the GPU.
- **Jan** ([Managing models](https://docs.jan.ai/jan/manage-models)): imports a GGUF by link (symlink) or copy, chosen by hand; it does not find LM Studio or Ollama models by itself. KesherAI already finds them and uses them in place.
- **LM Studio**: keeps its own embedding model (nomic) in `.lmstudio/.internal/bundled-models`, not in `models/`. Changed: 0.6.40 looks there too.

### Import from other apps
- **LibreChat** ([Import conversations](https://www.librechat.ai/docs/features/import_convos)): ChatGPT and Claude `conversations.json`, ChatbotUI, LibreChat; the format is read from the content; limits 250 MiB per file, about 16 MB per chat. KesherAI already imports ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini chats.
  - Changed: VISION "Import from other apps" now lists what is still missing (agents, personas, presets, Ollama Modelfiles, Open WebUI/LobeHub agents, Jan assistants, AnythingLLM workspaces, MCP from Claude Desktop/Cursor/VS Code).

### UX check (phone 390 px, computer 1280 px)
- Knowledge page: the setup text always promised a 0.64 GB download, and the brackets around the model name flipped in Hebrew. Fixed: it names the model already on the computer ("no download") and keeps the name in its own LTR span.
- Models page on the phone: fine; the "Qwen3 4B" name wraps next to its speed chip (minor, left as is).

### Importer formats (continued)
- **Open WebUI** ([Import & Export](https://docs.openwebui.com/features/chat-conversations/data-controls/import-export.md)): chats export as a JSON array of `{ chat: { title, models, history: { currentId, messages: { id → { id, parentId, childrenIds, role, content, model, timestamp } } } }, meta.tags, pinned, archived, folder_id, created_at }`. Messages are a tree, like ChatGPT's `mapping` (which Open WebUI also reads). Its docs page covers chats only; agents/prompts export is not documented there.
- **Ollama Modelfile** ([reference](https://docs.ollama.com/modelfile.md)): `FROM` (model, GGUF or folder), `PARAMETER` (`num_ctx`, `temperature`, `top_k`, `top_p`, `min_p`, `repeat_penalty`, `repeat_last_n`, `seed`, `stop`, `num_predict`), `TEMPLATE`, `SYSTEM`, `MESSAGE` (example turns), `LICENSE`, `REQUIRES`, `CAPABILITY`. `ollama show --modelfile <name>` prints one; KesherAI already reads the manifests in `.ollama/models` to find the GGUF.
- **Draft mapping to KesherAI** (for the importer):

  | From | KesherAI |
  |---|---|
  | Modelfile `SYSTEM` + `MESSAGE` | a persona (instructions + example turns) |
  | Modelfile `PARAMETER temperature/top_p/num_ctx/stop` | the persona's model settings |
  | Modelfile `FROM` (a GGUF) | the model, used in place (model-scan) |
  | Open WebUI chat (`history.messages` tree, `currentId` branch) | a chat (same as the ChatGPT tree reader) |
  | Open WebUI `meta.tags`, `pinned`, `folder_id` | chat tags / pinned / project |

### Microsoft TokenEconomizer (coding-agent cost) — asked by Roee
Sources: [EveryDev summary](https://www.everydev.ai/tools/tokeneconomizer), [explainx breakdown](https://explainx.ai/blog/microsoft-tokeneconomizer-coding-agent-cost-control-plugin-claude-code-codex-copilot-2026), repo [microsoft/TokenEconomizer](https://github.com/microsoft/TokenEconomizer) (the MarkTechPost page Roee sent would not load here).
- A plugin for Claude Code, Codex, Copilot CLI and Pi. It learns from finished sessions in one repo and changes what later sessions get; the model and agent stay as they are. Its data stays local (`~/.tokeneconomizer`).
- **Micro-skills** (off by default): repo facts that sessions keep finding by failing (e.g. `python -m pytest` works, `pytest` does not). A fact is added at session start only after 3 sessions confirm it and is dropped when a later one contradicts it. The `envfacts` mode learns from failures alone, with no model calls.
- **Tool pruning** (on): a tool unused in 10 prompts across 2+ sessions, or in 5 sessions, is left out of later sessions (restore command; the deny list is written only after 60 idle minutes so the prompt cache is not broken mid-work).
- **Loop guard** (on): a turn repeating the same failing edit-and-test is checked by a judge model, and a redirect is sent at most once per turn (at 70%+ confidence). It never stops the turn itself, and it waits for 5 normal turns in the repo first.
- **Results** (authors' harness, not yet replicated): SWE-Bench 277 tasks, 18.4–30.9% cheaper, pass@1 up in 4 of 5. Web-Bench 16–21%. Smaller savings when every task is a fresh repo.
- **What KesherAI already has:** a loop guard on repeated identical changing actions (agent/session.ts); tools loaded on demand (`find_tools`) instead of all at once; known engine issues injected before builds (known-issues.ts); self-work's handoff.md.
- **What to learn (added to VISION):**
  1. **Project facts learned from failures**, per workspace: after the same command fails the same way and a fix works in 2–3 chats, tell every new chat or self-work run about it at the start (and drop it when contradicted). This matters most for local models with a 24K-token context, which cannot afford to rediscover things.
  2. **Tool pruning per project**: the always-on tool list (MCP servers included) is a big part of every request to a local model. Leave out tools a project never uses, with a visible list and a restore button.
  3. **Failure-loop guard on checks**: the same check failing the same way after edits (self-work's check, check_code) triggers one redirect note ("step back, read the error, try another approach"), never a stop. Today's guard counts identical actions only.
  4. **Measure it**: chat-stats already counts waste; show tokens per finished item in self-work.

### Where it stopped
- TokenEconomizer: done (above). Next for it: read the repo's plugin/README for the exact fact format and the prune thresholds before building item 1.
- Next: **LobeHub agent JSON**: read `agent-template-full.json` and `schema/` in [lobe-chat-agents](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat-agents) (fields `identifier`, `meta`, `config.systemRole`…), then **Open WebUI models/agents** (its admin "Models" export), then **Jan assistants** and **AnythingLLM workspaces**.
- Next UX pages to look at, at 390 px: Unreal (C++ tab), Unity (Rider mode pill), Settings → Active models.
