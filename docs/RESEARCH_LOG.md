# Research log

Research done while nothing could run on the PC and no release could ship. Each entry: what was looked at, what was found, what it changed, and **where it stopped** (the next session starts there).

## 2026-11-10

### Running models without other apps (llama.cpp, Jan, LM Studio)
- **llama.cpp fitting** ([discussion #18049](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/18049)): `--fit` is on by default and leaves 1 GB free per GPU (`-fitt`); it shrinks the context first, then moves tensors to system RAM, MoE experts first. Any explicit `-ngl`, `--tensor-split` or `--override-tensor` turns it off completely. An explicit `-c` is kept.
  - Changed: 0.6.41 drops KesherAI's old `-ngl 99` default on b7400+ builds (it froze self-work when two models shared the 3090), and the embedding engine no longer forces the GPU.
- **Jan** ([Managing models](https://docs.jan.ai/jan/manage-models)): imports a GGUF by link (symlink) or copy, chosen by hand; it does not find LM Studio or Ollama models by itself. KesherAI already finds them and uses them in place.
- **LM Studio**: keeps its own embedding model (nomic) in `.lmstudio/.internal/bundled-models`, not in `models/`. Changed: 0.6.40 looks there too.

### Import from other apps
- **LibreChat** ([Import conversations](https://www.librechat.ai/docs/features/import_convos)): ChatGPT and Claude `conversations.json`, ChatbotUI, LibreChat; the format is read from the content; limits 250 MiB per file, about 16 MB per chat. KesherAI already imports ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini chats.
  - Changed: VISION "Import from other apps" now lists what is still missing (agents, personas, presets, Ollama Modelfiles, Open WebUI/LobeHub agents, Jan assistants, AnythingLLM workspaces, MCP from Claude Desktop/Cursor/VS Code).

### UX check (phone 390 px, computer 1280 px)
- Knowledge page: the setup text always promised a 0.64 GB download, and the brackets around the model name flipped in Hebrew. Fixed: it names the model already on the computer ("no download") and keeps the name in its own LTR span.
- Models page on the phone: fine; the "Qwen3 4B" name wraps next to its speed chip (minor, left as is).

### Importer formats (continued)
- **Open WebUI** ([Import & Export](https://docs.openwebui.com/features/chat-conversations/data-controls/import-export.md)): chats export as a JSON array of `{ chat: { title, models, history: { currentId, messages: { id → { id, parentId, childrenIds, role, content, model, timestamp } } } }, meta.tags, pinned, archived, folder_id, created_at }`. Messages are a tree, like ChatGPT's `mapping` (which Open WebUI also reads). Its docs page covers chats only; agents/prompts export is not documented there.
- **Ollama Modelfile** ([reference](https://docs.ollama.com/modelfile.md)): `FROM` (model, GGUF or folder), `PARAMETER` (`num_ctx`, `temperature`, `top_k`, `top_p`, `min_p`, `repeat_penalty`, `repeat_last_n`, `seed`, `stop`, `num_predict`), `TEMPLATE`, `SYSTEM`, `MESSAGE` (example turns), `LICENSE`, `REQUIRES`, `CAPABILITY`. `ollama show --modelfile <name>` prints one; KesherAI already reads the manifests in `.ollama/models` to find the GGUF.
- **Draft mapping to KesherAI** (for the importer):

  | From | KesherAI |
  |---|---|
  | Modelfile `SYSTEM` + `MESSAGE` | a persona (instructions + example turns) |
  | Modelfile `PARAMETER temperature/top_p/num_ctx/stop` | the persona's model settings |
  | Modelfile `FROM` (a GGUF) | the model, used in place (model-scan) |
  | Open WebUI chat (`history.messages` tree, `currentId` branch) | a chat (same as the ChatGPT tree reader) |
  | Open WebUI `meta.tags`, `pinned`, `folder_id` | chat tags / pinned / project |

### Microsoft TokenEconomizer (coding-agent cost) — asked by Roee
Sources: [EveryDev summary](https://www.everydev.ai/tools/tokeneconomizer), [explainx breakdown](https://explainx.ai/blog/microsoft-tokeneconomizer-coding-agent-cost-control-plugin-claude-code-codex-copilot-2026), repo [microsoft/TokenEconomizer](https://github.com/microsoft/TokenEconomizer) (the MarkTechPost page Roee sent would not load here).
- A plugin for Claude Code, Codex, Copilot CLI and Pi. It learns from finished sessions in one repo and changes what later sessions get; the model and agent stay as they are. Its data stays local (`~/.tokeneconomizer`).
- **Micro-skills** (off by default): repo facts that sessions keep finding by failing (e.g. `python -m pytest` works, `pytest` does not). A fact is added at session start only after 3 sessions confirm it and is dropped when a later one contradicts it. The `envfacts` mode learns from failures alone, with no model calls.
- **Tool pruning** (on): a tool unused in 10 prompts across 2+ sessions, or in 5 sessions, is left out of later sessions (restore command; the deny list is written only after 60 idle minutes so the prompt cache is not broken mid-work).
- **Loop guard** (on): a turn repeating the same failing edit-and-test is checked by a judge model, and a redirect is sent at most once per turn (at 70%+ confidence). It never stops the turn itself, and it waits for 5 normal turns in the repo first.
- **Results** (authors' harness, not yet replicated): SWE-Bench 277 tasks, 18.4–30.9% cheaper, pass@1 up in 4 of 5. Web-Bench 16–21%. Smaller savings when every task is a fresh repo.
- **What KesherAI already has:** a loop guard on repeated identical changing actions (agent/session.ts); tools loaded on demand (`find_tools`) instead of all at once; known engine issues injected before builds (known-issues.ts); self-work's handoff.md.
- **What to learn (added to VISION):**
  1. **Project facts learned from failures**, per workspace: after the same command fails the same way and a fix works in 2–3 chats, tell every new chat or self-work run about it at the start (and drop it when contradicted). This matters most for local models with a 24K-token context, which cannot afford to rediscover things.
  2. **Tool pruning per project**: the always-on tool list (MCP servers included) is a big part of every request to a local model. Leave out tools a project never uses, with a visible list and a restore button.
  3. **Failure-loop guard on checks**: the same check failing the same way after edits (self-work's check, check_code) triggers one redirect note ("step back, read the error, try another approach"), never a stop. Today's guard counts identical actions only.
  4. **Measure it**: chat-stats already counts waste; show tokens per finished item in self-work.

### TokenEconomizer internals (for KesherAI's "project facts")
- From the repo (`tokeneconomizer/microskills/README.md`, `docs/PLUGIN.md`): each finished session goes through *observe → propose → keep or retire*.
  - **Observe:** shell commands are split into segments and classified by intent (tests, interpreter, build/check, package tool, fetch, VCS probe) and by form (the exact spelling); the outcome is an error class or "tests ran".
  - **The five fact families with no model call:** *form repair* (a failing spelling followed by a working one: `pytest` → `python -m pytest`), *boundary* (every fetch to a host is refused), *empty probe* (VCS probes that always return nothing), *arg repair* (a test label that works once rewritten), and *env value* (a missing variable a later run sets).
  - **Lifecycle:** active after 3 confirming sessions; retired on contradiction (2 in a row for a spelling fact); injected only while the failure it prevents still shows up in at least 40% of the sessions that touch it (over 4 or more).
  - **Caps:** 4 facts and about 150 tokens; a lint refuses facts that read like "you are done" or verification advice.
- **Security note they make:** the facts come from command output, which the repository controls, so the free layer only fills fixed templates with the observed command forms and hosts. Free text from a model is riskier (prompt injection). KesherAI should do the same: templated facts only, shown in a list the user can remove from.
- **Loop guard:** rules first (the same edits and failures repeated, a turn 2.5× its usual length), a judge model only when unsure, one redirect per turn, never a stop.

### LobeHub agent format
- [lobe-chat-agents](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat-agents) `agent-template-full.json` (schema `schema/lobeAgentSchema_v1.json`): `{ identifier, author, homepage, locale, meta: { title, description, avatar (emoji or URL), tags[] }, config: { systemRole, model, params: { temperature, top_p, frequency_penalty, presence_penalty }, displayMode, enableHistoryCount, historyCount, inputTemplate ("{{text}}" is the user's input) } }`.
- Mapping: `meta.title/description/avatar/tags` → persona name, description, icon, tags; `config.systemRole` → persona instructions; `params` → model settings; `historyCount` → how many past messages it keeps; `inputTemplate` → a prompt template (KesherAI prompts.ts).

### Token and speed optimizations for agents (asked by Roee: for Claude and for KesherAI)
Sources: [Pinggy: 8 tools](https://pinggy.io/blog/tools_to_reduce_ai_coding_agent_token_usage/), [Token reduction is not cost reduction (2,848 billed runs)](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/07/28/token-reduction-is-not-cost-reduction-prompt-cache-economics-codex-cli-tool-output-compaction-billing/), [SWE-Pruner, Pichay, ContextBudget](https://codex.danielvaughan.com/2026/06/17/context-pruning-research-swe-pruner-pichay-contextbudget-codex-cli-token-management-compaction/), [rtk](https://mintlify.com/rtk-ai/rtk/introduction), [Serena](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/oraios/serena).
- **The cache matters more than the token count.** In billed runs, cache writes (~44%) and reads (~35%) were most of the cost; tool output was a small share. Compressing tool output changed the prompt's prefix, broke the cache and patch anchors (applied patches fell from 27/40 to 15/40), and *raised* cost: RTK about −2.7%, RTK-ML +6.8%, Headroom +48%. Advice: keep the system prompt, the tool list and project notes fixed during a session; compact late (85–90% of the window), not often; measure cost per finished task.
- **Semantic tool selection:** embed the tool descriptions and send only the top-k for each request. In an AWS-documented test, tool text fell 82% (1,557 → 275 tokens) and wrong-tool picks fell 89%.
- **Goal-aware pruning** (SWE-Pruner, a 0.6B skimmer that keeps the lines relevant to a stated goal): 23–54% fewer tokens with the same solve rate. **Pichay** (OS-style paging of stale tool results): 21.8% of input was structural waste.
- **Code graph and symbol tools** (Serena with language servers; Graphify with tree-sitter): ask for one symbol instead of reading whole files.
- **Terse output** (Caveman skill): about 65% fewer output tokens. Output is slow on local models, so this matters most there.
- **Routing:** cheap models for simple tool calls, strong ones for reasoning (LiteLLM-style rules).
- **For KesherAI (local llama.cpp), the cost is time and context, not money:**
  1. **A stable prefix** lets llama.cpp reuse its slot cache instead of processing 20K tokens again every turn. Nothing dynamic should go before the conversation (time, changing tool lists), and a conversation should stay on one slot. Check what KesherAI sends today and measure prompt-processing time per turn.
  2. **Semantic tool selection** with the Qwen3 Embedding model KesherAI already runs: top-k tools per request for local models, with find_tools as the fallback.
  3. **Code symbols through the language servers** KesherAI already has (csharp-ls; add TypeScript/clangd): "show symbol X" tools instead of whole-file reads.
  4. **Terse mode** for local models (shorter answers, faster), and a "cost per finished item" counter in self-work.
- **For Claude (this session):** it runs in Anthropic's cloud, so nothing can be installed into it; what applies is working practice (narrow reads, filtered command output, no repeated reads, one stable plan). On Roee's own Claude Code: TokenEconomizer (above), and Serena as an MCP server for symbol-level reading; rtk is optional (small gain, can break the cache).

### Open WebUI workspace models (agents)
- [Workspace models](https://docs.openwebui.com/features/workspace/models.md): a wrapper around a base model with a system prompt (variables like `{{USER_NAME}}`), parameters (temperature, stop…), bindings (knowledge, tools, skills, filters, actions), capabilities (vision, web search, code interpreter) and meta (name, id, avatar, description, tags, prompt suggestions). Export is one `.json` holding every model you can edit; import stops at the first id that is taken and that you cannot edit.
- Mapping: system prompt → persona instructions (variables → KesherAI's own); params → model settings; base model → the model if it is local, else ask; knowledge bindings → a knowledge base of the same name if there is one (else listed as "to set up"); capabilities → tools on/off; prompt suggestions → the persona's starter prompts.

### Where it stopped
- TokenEconomizer: done, internals included (above). Next for it: the design for KesherAI's project facts (form repair + env value first, templated, per workspace, shown in the project page).
- Next: **Jan assistants** and **AnythingLLM workspaces**; then the design for KesherAI's project facts.
- Next UX pages to look at, at 390 px: Unreal (C++ tab), Unity (Rider mode pill), Settings → Active models.
